------------------

We're pleased to announce the release of dask-image 0.5.0!

Highlights

The biggest highlight of this release is our new affine transformation feature, contributed by Marvin Albert.

Special thanks go to everyone who joined us at the conference!

0.4.0 (2020-09-02)
------------------

We're pleased to announce the release of dask-image 0.4.0!

Highlights

The major highlight of this release is support for cupy GPU arrays for dask-image subpackages imread and ndfilters.
Cupy version 7.7.0 or higher is required to use this functionality.
GPU support for the remaining dask-image subpackages (ndmorph, ndfourier, and ndmeasure) will be rolled out at a later date, beginning with ndmorph.

We also have a new function, threshold_local, similar to the scikit-image local threshold function.

Lastly, we've made more improvements to the user documentation, which includes work by new contributor @abhisht51.

New Features

* GPU support for ndfilters & imread modules (#151)
* threshold_local function for dask-image ndfilters (#112)

Improvements

* Add function coverage table to the dask-image docs (#155)
* Developer documentation: release guide (#142)
* Use tifffile for testing instead of scikit-image (#145)
