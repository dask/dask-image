Importing dask-image
--------------------
Import dask image is with an underscore, like this example:

.. code-block:: python

    import dask_image.imread
    import dask_image.ndfilters


Dask Examples
-------------
We highly recommend checking out the dask-image-quickstart.ipynb notebook 
(and any other dask-image example notebooks) at the dask-examples repository.
You can find the dask-image quickstart notebook in the `applications` folder
of this repository:

https://github.com/dask/dask-examples

All the example notebooks are available to launch with
mybinder and test out interactively.


An Even Quicker Start
---------------------

You can read files stored on disk into a dask array
by passing the filename, or regex matching multiple filenames
into `imread()`.

.. code-block:: python

    filename_pattern = 'path/to/image-*.png'
    images = dask_image.imread.imread(filename_pattern)

If your images are parts of a much larger image, 
dask can stack, concatenate or block chunks together:
http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-stack.html


Calling dask-image functions is also easy.
.. code-block:: python

    import dask_image.ndfilters
    blurred_image = dask_image.ndfilters.gaussian_filter(images, sigma=10)


If you have a function that accepts input numpy arrays,
it is also likely to accept dask arrays without any modification. 

.. code-block:: python

    result = my_function(images)

Remember that dask computations are lazy. 
That's a great thing to have, most of the time.
If you need to force dask to run the computation, use the `compute()` method.

.. code-block:: python

    result.compute()


Further Reading
---------------

Good places to start include:
